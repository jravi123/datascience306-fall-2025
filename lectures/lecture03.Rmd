## Review

* Learned more about R's functions (required and optional arguments); `f(x, y = 10)`
* Piping and assignment; `|>, =`
* Special values: `NA`, `NULL`, and `NaN`
* Vectors: ordered collections of same type, many computations are *vectorized*; See example below
* Lists: ordered collections of mixed types; `c(1:10); list(1, c(1:10))`
* Tables: lists of vectors of the same length (column oriented); `tibble, data.frame`
* Other items: indexing with `[ ]` and `$`, `dim` and `colnames` for tables

**Example On Vectorized operations**

Multiply all elements by 10

```{r vectorized, exercise = T}
v = c(1:10)
print(v)

```

## Plotting: Visual representation of data

**Graphing** or **plotting** is the representation of data in a visual form, typically on a 2D plane.

Humans have a wonderful ability to process visual stimuli quickly.

Great for displaying large data sets that might be difficult to describe.

**But Plotting ain't easy**

* What exactly can we put in a plot?
* How to connect the plot to data?
* What are our goals for the plot?
* What additional information is necessary to understand the plot?

## The Semiology of Graphics

In 1967, **Jacques Bertin** published the *Semiology of Graphics* to describe common elements of plots and what they could achieve.

Bertin described two ways of thinking about plots:

1. Visual ("retinal") variables: connections between objects in the plot and underlying data
2. Relationship what types of relationships can the visual variables express


[Visual Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_variable)



## The Grammar of Graphics and `ggplot`

A follow up to Bertin's work was *The Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson.
This book described a programming language for graphics based on ideas in
Bertin's system.

The GoG was implemented for R in `ggplot` (and later replaced by `ggplot2`). 

## The main components of a ggplot graph

>* The graph object itself (creating using `ggplot(data)`)
>* A set of [aesthetic mappings](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html?q=scales#mapping) (connecting data to visual variables)
>* [Layers](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html?q=scales#layers): collections of geometric elements (`geom_*()`) and [statistical transformations](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/layer_stats.html) (`stat_*()`). Stat performs computation on the data before it is displayed
>* [Scales](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html?q=scales#scales): information on the range, breaks for labels and legends
>* [Coordinate systems](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html?q=scales#coordinates): how the data are arranged spatially
>* [Facet](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html?q=scales#facets): breaking a single plot into many, similar plots
>* [Theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html?q=scales#theme): all the other color and printing aspects of the plot

## Creating a ggplot

Start use the `ggplot` function to start our plot
```{r}
efficiency <- ggplot(data = mpg)
efficiency # for now, blank
```



**What can we plot?** Let us take a glimpse of the dataset
```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

"Aesthetic" mappings connect columns to visual variables
```{r}
efficiency <- ggplot(data = mpg,
                     aes(x = displ, 
                         y = hwy, 
                         color = cyl))

efficiency
```
displ: a carâ€™s engine size, in litres. A larger displacement (e.g., a 5.0L V8 engine) means the engine can
burn more air and fuel in each cycle, which generally translates to more power but is it at the cost of fuel efficiency? Let us find out.

hwy: highway miles/gallon
cyl: number of cylinders


But the chart is still blank? Well we need to add the geometric layer to define how to display the visual elements

## Geometries: objects on the plot

We will use a **geometry function** (have the form `geom_TYPE()`).

```{r}
efficiency + geom_point()
```


**Alternative forms**

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))

mpg |> ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))

mpg |> ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + geom_point(aes(y = hwy, color = cyl))
```

Note: You can use positional arguments or use `data`, `mapping` argument names to call these functions

Mapping values from `ggplot` are inherited by layers


      
## Question
Is the cylinder really a continuous variable?
How else can I make this better?

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE}
mpg |> ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))

```
## Insight

Using `factor()` tells ggplot2 to treat cyl as distinct categories, assigning a unique color to each one, which is exactly what you want.

```{r}
mpg |> ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl)))

```

The chart illustrates the fundamental trade-off in
automotive engineering between power (larger displacement and more cylinders) and fuel economy. Cars with smaller, 4-cylinder engines are fuel-efficient, while cars with larger, 8-cylinder engines offer more power at the cost of higher fuel consumption.

## Exercise: Great Lakes water levels

Here's a data set from the US Army Corps of Engineers showing the height of the Great Lakes (with Michigan and Huron being one body) above sea level, aggregate by year.

```{r read_csv}
glwl <- read_csv("data/GLHYD_data_english_cleaned.csv.gz") |>
  group_by(body, year) |> summarize(ht = median(height_ft)) |> ungroup()
glwl
```

Use this data set to make a scatter plot of the height of each lake in each year, colored by which `body` the reading is from.

```{r glwl-plot-setup}

glwl <- read_csv("data/GLHYD_data_english_cleaned.csv.gz") |>
  group_by(body, year) |> summarize(ht = median(height_ft)) |> ungroup()
```

```{r glwl-plot, exercise = TRUE}

```

Improve your plot by changing it to a `geom_line()`

## What aesthetic mappings can I use?


**Trying out some other mappings**

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cyl, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Visit the docs to learn more: [geom_point](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html)

## Using expressions

We can also use expressions involving columns.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = year > 2000)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Overriding parameters for all points

We can pass in constants that apply to all points (size and transparency):

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = year > 2000)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5)
```

## Jitter: useful noise

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```



## General observations

* Generally limit plots to having 3 or 4 distinct visual variables
* Almost everything can be tweaked in ggplot, finding it is the tricky part
* The [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) is a great source of inspiration and instruction






## Other geometries

Points are great for graphing two **quantitative** or **continuous** variables.
For **discrete** or **qualitative** we need other charts.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = class)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
```



## List of geometries

[More ggplot documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#geoms).

## Statistical Summaries

* In addition to the raw data (or our calculations), our plots involved **data summaries** 
* `ggplot2` calls these **summary statistics** or `stat_*` functions
* We already saw a summaries in the boxplot: quantiles, twice IQR bars
* We can access summaries that geometries compute and add additional summaries.

## Boxplot as statistic

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = class)) + 
  stat_boxplot() 
```

Compare with

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = class)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
```

`geom_boxplot()` is a convenient wrapper that automatically uses
  `stat_boxplot()` behind the scenes to do the calculations.

You would use `stat_boxplot()` explicitly if you wanted to use its calculations but draw them with a different geom.

Example: Let's say you want to show the range of a boxplot (the
whiskers) but not with a box. You could use the calculations from
`stat_boxplot()` but represent them with an errorbar geom.

## Adding computed summaries

The `stat_summary` function allows you to use any function to summarize 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = class)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, size = 3, color = "red", geom = "point") 
```

## Trend lines

When using scatter plots, one of the most common summaries is a **trend line**.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_smooth() # geom_smooth also works
```

## More layering

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = hwy), color = "orange") +
  geom_point(aes(y = cty), color = "blue") +
  stat_smooth(aes(y = hwy), lty = 1, color = "black") +
  stat_smooth(aes(y = cty), lty = 2, color = "red")
```

We'll see a better way to make this table when we talk about tall vs. wide format data.

## Overriding defaults of `stat` functions

Each `geom_*` has a default statistic function. We can override this.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar() # default stat is count
```

Override the default

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  labs(title = 'Mean highway miles per class')
```

## Replacing tables

We often use **tables** in documents to give numerical summaries. But why not
replace those with a nice graphic?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  stat_summary(
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```

## Exporting Plots

* Automatically included in knitted RMarkdown documents
* Export from the Plots panel in RStudio
* `ggsave` function to save to file (variety of formats)
