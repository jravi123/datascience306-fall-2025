## DATASCI 306: Introduction to Statistical Computing

This course introduces basic concepts in computer programming and statistical computing techniques as they are applied to data extraction and manipulation, statistical processing and visualization. It is aimed primarily at undergraduate majors and minors in Statistics.

*Enforced Pre-requisite: [DATASCI 101 or STATS 206 or STATS 250 OR STATS 280 OR STATS 412 or ECON 451 or IOE 265] AND prior or concurrent enrollment in [MATH 116 or MATH 121 or MATH 156 or MATH 176 or MATH 186 or any 200+ level math credit except for MATH 201].*

## Syllabus

Detailed [Syllabus](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/781354/assignments/syllabus)

Now we will go over some highlights

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will

* have a rigorous understanding of the structure of computer programs including
  * variables
  * functions
  * iteration
  * input/output
* have thorough familiarity with the R programming language and RStudio development environment
* be able to load, manipulate, and present data


## Grading
* Homework (25%). There will be about 8 weekly problem sets. Most weeks, they will be posted on Friday and due the following Friday. Late submissions are not accepted, but we will drop your lowest two scores when calculating your homework average. You may discuss the homework with other students or use other resources from the Web, but you must write up your own solutions by understanding every statement that makes up your answer.

* Exams:
  * Midterm Exam - 1 (25%)
  * Midterm Exam - 2 (25%)

* Final Group Project (25%)



## Working in Groups

You are encouraged to work together on **all class material** to discuss solutions and debug. However, each student must submit own work. Ask yourself, "Am I avoiding learning something in my actions?" If yes, don't do it.


## Materials

All books are freely available through our library system or online:

* Our main text book is [R for Data Science (2ed)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garett Grolemund
* Later in the semester, we will pull additional material from
    * [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html)
    * [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)
* For learning git, we will use [Beginning Git and GitHub](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187305231206381) by
Mariot Tsitoara.
* For statistical background, we suggest [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187344801606381)


## Software

* R: A statistical programming language
* RStudio (Cloud): A development environment for R
* Git: Version control and collaboration for software projects

  
## R, a statistical programming language

R is a *statistical programming language*:

* Open source - Free
* Specifically designed for statistical computing and visualization
* Being adopted by research, industry, government
* Strong Community and Support

## What is Git?

* A **version control system** manages changes from multiple sources simultaneously.
* A reasonable analogy: Google Docs with track changes turned on
* Useful for groups working together to track changes to the software package and document why changes were made
* We will use it to disseminate labs, and lecture materials.


## How does git work?

* Creates a **repository** (a hidden directory/folder) to keep information about the history of files using `git init` command (more on this soon!)
* When you make changes, you may **add** them to a **staging area**
* When you think you have completed a functionality, you **commit** your changes to save a snapshot.
* Git stores the **differences** ("diffs") from the previous version to your new version.
* You can **push** your changes to a shared repository like `github` or `bitbucket` for others to use
* You can **pull** from a shared repository and **merge** the changes of others.
* If there are **conflicts**, git will let you know and make you resolve them.
* If you ever need to see what changed, you have the entire **history** of all changes to look at.

### To get the latest lecture notes/labs, you have to periodically execute a `git pull` to get the updates.

## Using our Posit Cloud

In this course, you may use Posit Cloud to run all lectures, homework and labs. 

Alternative environments include:

* <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r' target = "_blank"> Colab </a>
* RStudio on your local machine. Download RStudio from here:https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
* From R terminal after you download R:https://cran.rstudio.com/



## Some basic POSIX CLI commands

CLI - **command line interface** is the text based UI (User Interface) to run commands as opposed to using GUI (Graphical User Interface)

In an CLI you have an **interactive** prompt where you type a command. It might look something like this:

```
$ command -o --options argument1 argument2
```

* `$` is the prompt
* `command` is what we want to do (e.g., `cd, git etc.`)
* Optional flags have `-` or `--` in front and change behavior
* We can tell what to do with `argument1` and `argument2`. Some commands have no arguments.


* `cd dir_name`: Change directory. 
* `ls`: List files in current directory
* `pwd`: Print working directory
* `mkdir dir_name`: Make a new directory (folder)
* `rm -r`: Recursively delete directories and everything inside (use carefully!). There is no recycle bin that keeps the deleted files when you run this command. All files are permanently gone!

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_POSIX_commands

## Using git with CLI

While `git` has graphical interfaces, we will also learn to use CLI for git.

When interacting with git, we will use commands like this:

```
$ git SUBCOMMAND -o --options ARG1 ARG2 ...
```

Some example sub commands will be `pull` to get updates, `log` to see the history, `add` to stage files, and `commit` to commit changes.

## Let git know who you are

```
$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL"
```

## Getting a copy of the DATASCI 306 Repository

Materials for this course are hosted at **GitHub**, a popular website front end for git. 

To get a copy of them, **clone** the repository, say on your local computer, you would run:

```
$ cd LOCATION_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_REPO
$ git clone https://github.com/jravi123/datascience306-fall-2025
```

## Getting future updates

```
$ cd PATH/TO/REPO
$ git pull
```

## Saving changes to our local repo

```
$ git status
$ git add FILENAME
$ ... perhaps other files ...
$ git commit -m "a note explaining changes"
```

## How to get the repo to Posit?

The [Shared Workspace](https://posit.cloud/spaces/678307/join?access_code=BJQmS98eb02wQyu83CFNehCFH6NTsCearUtQPNJd) already has the GitHub repo pulled in.  **This is read-only for you!**

**However, make sure you make a permanent copy of the project before you start making edits (especially the homework project) as every file you open from the shared workspace will be temporarily saved on your account and will not be available for the next time unless you make a permanent copy of the project in your account by clicking on the relevant button as shown below**

To get lecture/lab updates after a copy is made, please run `git pull` on your copy.


## What's in our project?

>* Data sets we use
>* Lab docs 
>* Lecture docs (like these)


All homework, labs, and lectures are **RMarkdown** documents.

## What is markdown?

* Markdown files are **plain text** files that have special tags for interpretation.
* They have a header (denoted by `---`) and a body. We can **render** them to HTML to view in any web browser.
* See the "Help -> Markdown Quick Ref" in RStudio for more details.

## RMarkdown

* RMarkdown extends basic markdown to allow embedding R code within the document.
* Blend **code** a.k.a.  **chunks** and **presentation**.
* When you **knit** the document, first the code is evaluated, then the results are added to the markdown document. Then that is turned into a web page.
* In addition to text and numeric output, plots and graphs are automatically inserted into the output.
* There are options to control how chunks are presented, cache computations to speed up knitting, etc.

## RMarkdown documents


General workflow:

* Open `.Rmd` file
* Run code in R chunks
* Edit text and code to answer prompts
* Knit to HTML/PDF files
* (Homework/projects) submit PDF files on Gradescope for homework




## Chunks in Rmd files

All chunks have the following form:

<!-- The extra stuff is to get this print out as if
it were an R chunk, even though it is not really one. -->
<pre><code>```{r name, key = value, ...}
... R code goes here ...
<span>```</span></code></pre>

* The `name` is optional but helps when you get an error.
* The `key = value` controls the behavior of the chunk (optional). Example, `include = FALSE` to hide chunk. Refer:[chunk options](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html?#chunk-options)

* `CTRL-ALT-I` inserts a new chunk your RMarkdown document.




## Getting started with R programming...
Let us solve some math problems.

* add 2 and 5 
* divide 5 by 2 
* multiply the resultant with 10
* create a vector of all numbers from 1 to 5, print the vector and find the mean of those numbers

```{r repl, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}


```



The "Start Over" button will give you a fresh environment.

## Expressions and Statements

When a program executes, you typically create temporary variables in the RAM of your computer. The values that these variables keep at any point of time during your R program execution is called its **state**.

An **expression** is R code that, when run, provides a value (do not change state):

```{r eval = F}
3 + 4
```

Commands that change the **state** of the program are called **statements**, such as assignment:

```{r}
a <- 3 + 4
```

Note: You can also use `=` in the above expression like `a = 3 + 4`. However, the recommended style from [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html?q=assignment#assignment-1) and Hadley(http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) is `<-` for assignments
